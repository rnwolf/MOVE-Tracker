# MOVE Tracker

A Python automation script for generating MOVE (Minimal Outcome-Value Effort) project progress reports. The script reads project data from Excel workbooks, computes progress logs, and generates Work Execution and Fever Charts to track project progress over time.

## Features

- **Automated Progress Tracking**: Generates comprehensive progress logs from project start to any snapshot date
- **Visual Charts**: Creates Work Execution and Fever Charts as PNG images
- **Excel Integration**: Reads from and updates Excel workbooks with calculated data and embedded charts
- **Template Generation**: Creates properly structured Excel templates for new projects
- **Flexible CLI**: Command-line interface with multiple options for different use cases
- **Visual Regression Testing**: Comprehensive test suite for chart visual consistency

## Context

The MOVE Tracker is a desktop tool to help you mananage a collection of work-items using Tameflow approaches.

A collection of work-items that need to be delivered together in order to provide value is called a MOVE in Tameflow jargon.

The tool helps you to create **Work Execution** and **Fever Charts**.

### Work Execution Chart (Similar to a Burnup Chart)

### Fever Charts (A CCPM-style chart based on the buffer and work done)

CCPM = [Critical Chain Project Management]()

What are Fever Charts?

The idea come stems from the daily temperature checks made on patients in hospital. If the temperature chart is deviates from normal the nurse will call the doctor to consider further action.

![image of a nurse taking patients thermometer reading and recording it in a fever chart](<images/cartoon image of a nurse taking patients thermometer reading and recording it in a fever chart.webp>){ width=200px }


The fever chart is divided up into action zones. These colour of the current state of the buffers triggers decisions, lile a traffic light ðŸš¦ :

    - Green: Continue execution as planned.
    - Yellow: Investigate root causes, prepare mitigation.
    - Red: Escalateâ€”reallocate resources, mob, re-sequence tasks, or replan.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.13 or higher (A programming language)
- UV package manager,  recomended (Utility used to install dependencies used by Python to generate charts)
- Spreadsheet program like Excel or LibreOffice

Why Python? Spreadsheets are not able to create the detailed charts we require, Python charting packages are. But as Python is now the standard for data analysis and AI around the world it should be possible to make a case to get it installed on your computer. It's free but if you are in a corporate or enterprise environment you will likely need to make a case to get Python installed on your computer.

### Using UV (Recommended)

See UV [website for installations instructions.]((https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/))


```powershell
# Make a new working directory
mkdir MOVE-Tracker
cd MOVE-Tracker
```

Open the Github site https://github.com/rnwolf/MOVE-Tracker Have a look at the README.

Download the python script and save it as move_tracker_report.py to the directory you created above.

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rnwolf/MOVE-Tracker/refs/heads/master/move_tracker_report.py


```powershell
# Check that you have uv working
cd MOVE-Tracker
uv --version
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Display help

```bash
# Display built in help
uv run move_tracker_report.py --help
```

![Screen shot of help output](<images/Screenshot 2025-07-11 Help.png>)


### 2. Create a New Excel Project Template

Why use Excel sheet? Because desktop MS-Ecel provides a powerful, familiar user interface for editing data.

```bash
# Create a new Excel template with sample data
uv run move_tracker_report.py --create-template --excel-path "MyProject.xlsx"
```

### 3. Update Historic Data via Excel

In order to forecast future performance, we assume that it will be similar to past performance. Update the sample data in the spreadsheet.

![Screen shot of Historic work items](<images/Screenshot 2025-07-11 Historic work items.png>)

### 4. Update MOVE work items via Excel

Add the MOVE work items.  The commitment date should be specified which is likey to be the same date as the MOVE start date.
We also cater for the case were items are removed from the scope. Please do not delete the work-item row, rather update the withdrawn date for the work item.

### 5. Check the MOVE configuration

Make sure that all the paramter values are correct for your MOVE.

### 4.1 Generate Progress Report

```bash
# Generate progress report for a specific date
uv run move_tracker_report.py --excel-path "MyProject.xlsx" --snapshot-date "2025-01-15"
```

### 4.2. Or Generate Charts Only

```bash
# Generate charts without updating Excel file
uv run move_tracker_report.py --excel-path "MyProject.xlsx" --snapshot-date "2025-01-15" --save-charts-only ./charts
```

### 5 Review the generated Progress Log and charts

![Screenshot of Progress Log](<images/Screenshot 2025-07-11 Progress Log.png>)

## Usage Examples

### Command Line Options

```bash
uv run move_tracker_report.py [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**
- `--excel-path PATH`: Path to the Excel workbook (.xlsx)
- `--create-template`: Create a new Excel template
- `--snapshot-date DATE`: Date for processing (YYYY-MM-DD format)
- `--log-level LEVEL`: Logging verbosity (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
- `--no-chart-insertion`: Process data but skip inserting charts into Excel
- `--no-data-update`: Generate charts but skip updating Progress_Log sheet
- `--save-charts-only PATH`: Generate and save charts to specified directory only
- `--overwrite`: Overwrite existing files without prompting

### Examples

**Create a template:**
```bash
uv run move_tracker_report.py --create-template --excel-path "NewProject.xlsx"
```

**Generate full report:**
```bash
uv run move_tracker_report.py --excel-path "Project.xlsx" --snapshot-date "2025-01-15" --log-level INFO
```

**Generate charts only:**
```bash
uv run move_tracker_report.py --excel-path "Project.xlsx" --snapshot-date "2025-01-15" --save-charts-only ./output
```

## Excel File Structure

The script expects an Excel workbook with the following sheets:

### Required Sheets

1. **MOVE_Configuration**: Project parameters and settings
2. **Historic_Work_Items**: Past project data for baseline calculations
3. **Current_Work_Items**: Current project work items
4. **Progress_Log**: Generated time-series progress data (auto-created)

### Optional Sheets

- **Instructions**: User guidance (created in templates)
- **Work_Execution_Chart**: Work execution chart images (auto-created)
- **Fever_Chart**: Fever chart images (auto-created)

## Key Concepts

### MOVE approach

MOVE (Minimal Outcome-Value Effort) is a management approach that focuses on:
- **Scope Management**: Dynamic scope tracking with commitment dates
- **Flow Time**: Time from start to completion of work items
- **Buffer Management**: Green/Yellow/Red buffer zones for delivery forecasting
- **Visual Signals**: Charts that provide immediate project health indicators

### Charts Generated

1. **Work Execution Chart**: Shows actual work completed vs. scope over time with trend lines and buffer zones
2. **Fever Chart**: Displays project health using work done percentage vs. buffer consumption percentage


## For Developers

### Testing

The project includes comprehensive test suites:

#### Run All Tests

```bash
pytest
```

#### Run Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Excel integration tests
pytest tests/test_excel_integration.py -v

# Chart visual consistency tests
pytest tests/test_chart_visuals.py -v

# Enhanced chart testing (all snapshot dates)
pytest tests/test_chart_visuals_enhanced.py -v
